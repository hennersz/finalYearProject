#Pisces: The Python SPKI Library

##Background

SPKI (Simple Public Key Infrastructure) consists of a key certificate and signature formats and associated protocols that support security for a wide range of applications. The SPKI protocol is simple to understand, use, and implement.

The IETF's SPKI working group has produced two RFCs describing theory and requirements. More information is available from Carl Ellison's SPKI Certificate Documentation page. The current SPKI design represents a merger of Ellison's earlier SPKI work and SDSI, developed by Rivest and Lampson at MIT.

Version 1.0alpha Pisces was developed by Jeremy Hylton while at CNRI in 2000, and worked with Python version 1. It has since been updated by Daniel Lewis while at the University of South Wales, and has been tested to work with Python 2.7.10. It is still in alpha, and may break as it has not been extensively tested.

##License

The original, version 1.0alpha, was under an open source license through CNRI, and has been copied with the permission of Jeremy Hylton.

Subsequent versions are now under a permissive license called The MIT License. Please see the LICENSE file for more details.
